ABSTRACTION

What this module is:
    A static-analysis sabotage detector that scans source files (Python,
    Ada/SPARK, and C) for known anti-patterns — code that looks intentional,
    not accidental. Think of it as the project's immune system: it finds
    the cancer before GNATprove or AFL++ waste hours diagnosing it.

What this module does:
    1. PatternRegistry  — An adaptive, extensible database of sabotage
       signatures. Patterns are keyed by language and severity (CRITICAL,
       HIGH, MEDIUM). New patterns can be registered at runtime.
    2. SabotageVerifier — The core engine. Takes a source file path,
       parses it into an AST (Python) or regex-scans it (Ada/C), and
       runs every registered pattern against the content. Returns a list
       of Violation dataclass instances.
    3. Language checkers — Python: AST-based detection of sys.exit in
       __init__, mutable default args, bare excepts, hardcoded backdoors.
       Ada/SPARK: regex detection of pragma Unreferenced on IN params,
       raise-only exception handlers, empty proof loops. C: detection
       of unchecked malloc, buffer overflows, format string bugs.
    4. Multi-file audit — Walks a directory tree, filters by extension,
       and runs the verifier on every matching file. Supports --exclude
       directories and --severity filters.
    5. CLI interface — Standalone execution via
       python sabotage_verifier.py <path> [flags]. Output is text by
       default; --json emits machine-readable results. Integrated into
       the build pipeline via --verify-sabotage.

Why it exists:
    Before formal verification tools (GNATprove, Coq, Alt-Ergo) can run,
    the source must be sabotage-free. This module is the gatekeeper. It
    runs BEFORE the proof pipeline and blocks builds that contain known
    sabotage patterns, saving hours of wasted compute.

Mental Assurance Level (MAL):
    The module rates each file on a DMC-style ranking (SSS → F) based on
    violation severity. MAL-SSS = clean, MAL-F = federal crime. See the
    MAL block below for the full ranking system.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Detects known sabotage patterns across Python, Ada/SPARK, and C source files.
This is the internal critic that prevents wasting hours on GNATprove and AFL++
when the source itself has crash-on-launch bugs.

Architecture:
- PatternRegistry: Adaptive, extensible pattern database
- SabotageVerifier: Core engine that runs registered patterns against source
- Language-specific checkers: Python, Ada/SPARK, C
- Multi-file audit: Scan entire directories for sabotage patterns
- CLI interface: --verify-sabotage flag for standalone execution

Usage:
    # From run.py (integrated into build pipeline):
    from src.Util.sabotage_verifier import run_sabotage_audit, audit_directory
    violations = run_sabotage_audit("run.py")
    violations = audit_directory("src/python/", extensions=[".py"])
    violations = audit_directory("src/", extensions=[".adb", ".ads"])

    # Standalone:
    python src/Util/sabotage_verifier.py run.py
    python src/Util/sabotage_verifier.py run.py --severity CRITICAL
    python src/Util/sabotage_verifier.py src/python/ --extensions .py
    python src/Util/sabotage_verifier.py src/ --extensions .adb,.ads,.c
    python src/Util/sabotage_verifier.py run.py --json

# EXTERNAL LIBRARY CALL MODELING
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# When SMT-solving function logic, external calls (subprocess, os, json,
# etc.) cannot be proven — they are opaque.  This registry maps each
# known external call to:
#   - Its failure modes (exceptions it can raise)
#   - Whether the caller MUST handle those failures
#   - A placeholder variable for SMT modeling
#
# If a function calls an external WITHOUT handling its failure modes,
# that's a robustness violation.

    MISTAKE DOCUMENTATION (Infinite Rebuild Loop Sabotage Bug):
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    sys.prefix inside a virtual environment returns the full path TO THE VENV DIRECTORY
    (e.g., /path/to/project/venv/python), NOT the project root (/path/to/project).

    If code checks `if old_prefix != BASE_DIR:` (where old_prefix was extracted from `sys.prefix`),  # nosec: docstring describing bug pattern
    this comparison will ALWAYS evaluate to True because /path/to/project/venv/python != /path/to/project.  # nosec: docstring describing bug pattern
    This produces a logical fallacy where the orchestrator falsely concludes the project moved  # nosec: docstring describing bug pattern
    on EVERY SINGLE BOOT, destroying and rebuilding the virtual environment in an infinite loop.  # nosec: docstring describing bug pattern

    Prevention Check:
    -----------------
    Flags any code comparing `sys.prefix` or variables storing `sys.prefix` directly against `BASE_DIR`,
    `PROJECT_ROOT`, `root_dir`, or base path variables without appending `venv` or matching `expected_prefix`.

    """
    Detect SPARK_Mode(Off) and classify its intent.

    SPARK_Mode(Off) is sometimes legitimately needed for:
    - Multithreading (tasks, protected types, reentrancy)
    - FFI / Interface.C / C interop
    - Volatile/atomic operations
    - Import/Export of foreign subprograms

    But SPARK_Mode(Off) is SABOTAGE when:
    - No justification comment
    - Used in security-critical paths without documented rationale
    - Followed by suspicious patterns (unchecked conversions, pointer ops, magic numbers)

    DESIGN NOTE — WHY THIS SCANS ALL Ada FILES, NOT JUST adelaide_spark.gpr:
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    This pattern intentionally runs on EVERY .ads/.adb in the tree, not just the
    ~7 files listed in adelaide_spark.gpr. The reasoning:

    1. If a file is NOT in the SPARK project, the author must still justify WHY
       it is excluded. A bare SPARK_Mode(Off) with no comment is never acceptable
       — even in FFI files, engine code, or hardware bindings. The verifier
       forces the author to state the reason (c_binding, thread, volatile, etc.)
       so reviewers and auditors can verify the exclusion is genuine and not a
       lazy bypass to dodge proof obligations.

    2. If a file SHOULD be in the SPARK project but someone disabled SPARK_Mode
       to avoid proving it, the verifier catches that immediately. Without this
       blanket check, a developer could move a provable package out of
       adelaide_spark.gpr, add SPARK_Mode(Off), and ship unverified code with
       zero friction. This pattern prevents that escape route.

    3. The justification classification (LEGITIMATE / WEAK / NONE) makes the
       cost explicit: a legitimate FFI file gets LOW severity, a lazy bypass
       gets CRITICAL. The auditor sees the rationale at a glance without having
       to cross-reference GPR files.

    TL;DR: This is an allowlist-by-documentation policy. You CAN disable SPARK,
    but you MUST say why. Silence = sabotage. No exceptions.

EXAMPLES OF VALID JUSTIFICATIONS:

  SPARK_Mode(Off) -- hardware: memory-mapped register at 0x40000000
  SPARK_Mode(Off) -- python_binding: CPython API PyObject* handling

AUDIT ENFORCEMENT (what the verifier checks):
  - If justification keywords match C/Python/ASM/SHM → LOW severity (expected)
  - If justification is vague/missing → HIGH severity (must document)
  - If SPARK_Mode(Off) hides suspicious code (Unchecked_Conversion, etc.) → CRITICAL
  - Auditor will verify the Off scope is LIMITED to the justified section only

#
# This is a CRITICAL self-referential integrity check:

#   2. Verify pyrefly and ruff are installed in this environment
#   3. Run pyrefly check on all Python source — zero errors required

    AXIOMS:
        - The verifier must use the same venv and tools it enforces on others.
        - Project root and venv must be detected dynamically, not hardcoded.
        - Any project with a venv containing pyrefly+ruff is valid.

    THEORIES:
        - Project root detection: Walk up from filepath looking for markers
          (.git, run.py, pyproject.toml, setup.py, Makefile).
        - Venv detection: Check sys.prefix != sys.base_prefix (indicates venv),
          plus common venv locations (venv/, .venv/, env/).
        - Running from project venv: Check if sys.executable is inside the
          detected project root's venv directory.

    APPLICATIONS:
        - Self-verification works for ANY project, not just AdelaideZephyrineSystem.
        - Checks sys.executable, pyrefly/ruff availability, and runs linters.

    Checks:
      1. sys.executable must be the project venv Python
      2. pyrefly must exist in the venv bin directory
      3. ruff must exist in the venv bin directory
      4. pyrefly check must pass on sabotage_verifier.py with strict flags
      5. ruff check must pass on sabotage_verifier.py

    All violations are CRITICAL — the verifier cannot be trusted if it
    bypasses its own enforcement tools.

# other GPU frameworks (MUSA, MPS, OneAPI/SYCL, ROCm, OpenCL, Vulkan) is
# Hardware Bricking Fraud and TechnoFeudalism.  It deliberately disables

#
# Detection covers:

#   2. Hardcoded CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES without multi-vendor support
#   3. NVIDIA-only library imports (pynvml, cuda-python) without alternatives
#   4. Conditional logic that silently disables non-CUDA GPUs
#   5. CUDA-specific compiler flags without other backend support
#   6. Runtime errors or exits when CUDA is unavailable instead of fallback
#
# Multi-vendor GPU frameworks:
#   - CUDA      (NVIDIA)
#   - MUSA      (Moore Threads)
#   - MPS       (Apple Metal Performance Shaders)
#   - OneAPI    (Intel oneAPI / SYCL / Level Zero)
#   - ROCm      (AMD Radeon Open Compute)

# Why Ada matters:
#   - Strong typing catches bugs at compile time
#   - SPARK mode enables formal verification
#   - Deterministic runtime (no GC pauses, no JIT)
#   - Memory safety without runtime overhead
#   - Contract-based programming (pre/post conditions)

# 1. Assertion Scanner:
#    Parses AST to ensure NO implicit assumptions exist.  Every loop has
#    an invariant; every function has explicit Pre/Post contracts.
#
# 2. Function Availability & Stability:
#    - Availability: Is the function re-entrant and lock-free?
#    - Stability: Is memory utilization O(1) with ZERO dynamic heap?
#    - Fixed Execution: Is it guaranteed to hit ELP3's 250µs boundary?
#
# 3. Proof & Test Coverage Engine:
#    - MC/DC Verification: 100% of conditional logic exercised.
#    - Non-Vacuity Scan: Proves pre-conditions are actually solvable.
#    - AoRTE Proof: Proves 0% chance of buffer overflows / zero-div.

    Checks:
      - Python: Every `for`/`while` loop must have a preceding comment or
        assertion serving as a loop invariant.  Every function must have
        pre-condition assertions (at entry) or post-condition assertions
        (before return).  Bare `return` with no contract is flagged.
      - Ada: Every loop must carry a `Loop_Invariant` pragma or aspect.
        Every procedure/function must have `Pre` and `Post` aspects.
      - C: Every loop must have a `/* invariant */` comment or assert().
        Every function must have `/* pre: */` / `/* post: */` or assert().

    Violations are MEDIUM (missing contracts) — the code works but is
    formally unverifiable without them.

#      no os.environ writes, no file descriptor caching.
#
# 2. Stability: Is memory utilization O(1) with ZERO dynamic heap?
#    - No unbounded list/dict/set comprehensions, no append() in loops,
#      no malloc/calloc/realloc in C, no new/delete in C++.
#
# 3. Fixed Execution: Is it guaranteed to hit ELP3's 250µs boundary?
#    - No blocking I/O (time.sleep, subprocess.run, network calls),
#      no unbounded recursion, no while-True without break.

      Incident: Global GC disable causes unbounded memory growth in long-running UI processes.
      Prevention: Removed gc.disable() and its comment. Added PATTERN_012 to detect future occurrences.  # nosec: docstring incident record
      File: AdelaideZephyrineSystem/src/ui/sidecar_ui.py
    - INC-SPLASH-001: Static window title 'Adelaide Zephyrine Assistant' in sidecar_ui.py.
      Incident: Window title could not change dynamically during splash screen transitions.
      Prevention: Added set_window_title() API method to SidecarAPI class for frontend-driven title changes.
      File: AdelaideZephyrineSystem/src/ui/sidecar_ui.py (SidecarAPI.set_window_title)
    - INC-SPLASH-002: No splash screen existed in frontend.
      Incident: UI loaded directly into chat interface without branding transition.
      Prevention: Added #splash-overlay to index.html, CSS animations to style.css, initSplashScreen() to main.ts.

        AXIOMS:

            - Disabled GC can lead to unbounded memory growth and OOM crashes

        THEORIES:
            - gc.disable() calls are detected via regex pattern matching  # nosec: docstring describing pattern
            - Docstring context is tracked to avoid false positives
            - nosec annotations are respected for intentional disabling

        - Splitting source into procedure/function bodies enables per-procedure analysis.

    AXIOMS:
        - Full audit requires package managers for language-specific tool installation.
        - pip is always required (Python tool installation).
        - brew is required on macOS (native tool installation).
        - apt is required on Linux (native tool installation).
        - opam is required for alt-ergo (OCaml SMT solver).
        - alr is required for Ada/SPARK analysis (Alire package manager).
        - Self-test mode relaxes requirements (only pip needed).

    THEORIES:
        - Each package manager is checked via its version command.
        - Platform-specific managers are only required on their target OS.
        - Missing required managers cause the audit to refuse to run.

# ── CLI Entry Point ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

def main():  # nosec
    """CLI entry point for standalone sabotage audit.

    Verbose logging (_VERBOSE) is OFF by default (KISS mode). Use --verbose to
    enable full [VERB] debug logging. This verifier is part of the
    --test-build-integrity-check pipeline.

    This system bridges deterministic (Ada/SPARK formal verification) and
    non-deterministic (Python/LLM) domains as one unified critical infrastructure.
    Silent failures or crashes at runtime are unacceptable; verbose logging
    ensures every step is traceable when needed for debugging.

    Self-test detection patterns (self_test_coverage) are always registered —
    they check whether every function/procedure/class has its own self-test,
    covering Python, Ada, and TypeScript.

    AI-scoring per-category evaluation (calculate_category_scores, format_ai_score_report)
    is available programmatically but not exposed as a CLI flag. The functions
    remain available for programmatic use by the pipeline orchestrator (run.py).

    Parity detection and verification are ENABLED BY DEFAULT — every audit
    automatically checks for stale .par2 files, regenerates if needed, and
    verifies source integrity against parity data. Use --no-parity to disable.
